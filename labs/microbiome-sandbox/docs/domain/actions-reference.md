# Actions Reference

Exhaustive catalog of every trigger (stressor) and inoculation (intervention) in Bio-Dynamics.

Source: [`src/sim/engine.ts`](../src/sim/engine.ts) (`trigger()`, `inoculate()`), region availability from [`src/data/regions.ts`](../src/data/regions.ts).

Actions are **region-gated**: calling a disallowed action logs `"Trigger/Inoculation \"{id}\" not available for {region} tissue"` and has no effect.
